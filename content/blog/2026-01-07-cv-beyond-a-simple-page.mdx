excerpt: "Why a one-page CV matters, what it can’t show, and why sharing a second page helps communicate the human side of work."

A recruiter once told me they spend about 6–7 seconds scanning a CV before deciding whether to keep reading.

That means every word, every layout choice, and every example has to work fast. Clarity and brevity aren’t just nice to have — they are the only way to get past that first glance.

But if a CV is a first impression, it’s also necessarily incomplete.

## Why a one-page CV still matters

Across career advice sites and recruiter threads, the same patterns show up:
- Recruiters scan quickly — they need the most important info instantly.
- A clean structure with clear headings, bullets, and concise sections makes that scan possible.
- Tailoring your CV to the role helps both humans and the automated systems many companies use before a person ever sees it.

A one-page CV forces you to distill experience into the most relevant, impactful statements — what you did and what you achieved. That’s essential when hundreds or even thousands of applications compete for attention.

So the discipline of one page is real — and useful.

## What a one-page CV doesn’t show

There’s another side to the story, and it’s where most templates and advice stop short.

A CV can show what you’ve done — roles, tools, projects, dates.  
But it almost never shows how you think, how you work with others, or why you choose one approach over another.

These are often the things that matter most in real work:
- How you learn from ambiguity
- How you communicate across teams
- How you handle breakdowns or conflict
- How you prioritize multiple valid options
- How you decide what not to do

Reddit discussions on soft skills confirm it: listing them as buzzwords isn’t effective; what matters is context and examples of how you use them.

## Hard skills vs soft skills

When a recruiter scans a page, they see familiar formats:
- technologies used
- roles held
- quantifiable achievements

These are important — they tell the reader you have done the work.  
But they don’t tell the reader who did the work.

Soft skills — empathy, curiosity, collaboration, communication — are harder to summarize on a single line. Simply listing them rarely works; even Reddit discussions suggest that soft skills are only valuable when tied to how they were applied.

That’s why I chose to include:
- a one-page CV that meets the expectations of recruiters and automated systems  
- a second page / attached context that shares how I think and work

The first page answers what you’ve done.  
The second page answers why and how you’ve done it — and what that means in real collaboration.

## Beyond the PDF

If a CV is the first impression, the narrative that surrounds it is the story.
Your CV can get a recruiter to pause.  
It’s the narrative beyond the page that invites them to engage.

I’m sharing my CV here not as an endpoint, but as a starting point for conversation.

If this way of thinking resonates — not just what I’ve done, but how I approach work and learn — I’d be happy to talk about what we can build together.

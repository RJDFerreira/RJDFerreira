  intro: "I’m a product-driven engineer working at the intersection of hardware, software, and complex systems, with more than a decade of experience in medtech products. I’m currently based in Paris, France, and I originally trained as a biomedical and electrical engineer in Portugal, later specializing in mechatronics.",
  fullBio: `Curiosity has been the main driver of my career. Early on, I was drawn to understanding systems end to end — which led me to explore deeply across electronics, firmware, mechanics, and real-time software. That drive pushed me to seek challenging environments early, including international internships in different countries and, later, a move to France to work on state-of-the-art technologies.

My early work was hands-on and technical, spanning embedded systems, power electronics, industrial control, and medical instrumentation. Over time, my focus shifted from building individual subsystems to owning entire products. 
At Dreem, I evolved from hardware engineering into a technical product role, helping scale medical devices from prototypes to thousands of deployed units. 
More recently at Chipiron, I led engineering and product definition for a next-generation MRI platform, translating deep-tech research into manufacturable, product-ready systems while building and leading multidisciplinary teams.

Across these experiences, I’ve remained motivated by the same challenge: turning advanced technology into reliable, usable products through strong systems thinking and alignment between research, engineering, and execution. Outside of work, I’m a lifelong learner with a strong interest in human behavior and team dynamics. I’m also a father, which has reshaped how I think about responsibility, impact, and the human dimension of technology.`

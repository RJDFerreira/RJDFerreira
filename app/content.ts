  title: "About Ricardo Ferreira",
  aboutHeading: "About",
  intro:
    "I’m a product-driven engineer working at the intersection of hardware, software, " +
    "and complex systems, with more than a decade of experience in medtech products. " +
    "I’m currently based in Paris, France, and I originally trained as a biomedical " +
    "and electrical engineer in Portugal, later specializing in mechatronics.",

  fullBio:
    "Curiosity has been the main driver of my career. Early on, I was drawn to " +
    "understanding systems end to end — which led me to explore deeply across " +
    "electronics, firmware, mechanics, and real-time software. That drive pushed " +
    "me to seek challenging environments early, including international internships " +
    "in different countries and, later, a move to France to work on state-of-the-art technologies.\n\n" +

    "My early work was hands-on and technical, spanning embedded systems, power " +
    "electronics, industrial control, and medical instrumentation. Over time, my focus " +
    "shifted from building individual subsystems to owning entire products.\n" +
    "At Dreem, I evolved from hardware engineering into a technical product role, " +
    "helping scale medical devices from prototypes to thousands of deployed units.\n" +
    "More recently at Chipiron, I led engineering and product definition for a " +
    "next-generation MRI platform, translating deep-tech research into manufacturable, " +
    "product-ready systems while building and leading multidisciplinary teams.\n\n" +

    "Across these experiences, I’ve remained motivated by the same challenge: " +
    "turning advanced technology into reliable, usable products through strong " +
    "systems thinking and alignment between research, engineering, and execution. " +
    "Outside of work, I’m a lifelong learner with a strong interest in human behavior " +
    "and team dynamics. I’m also a father, which has reshaped how I think about " +
    "responsibility, impact, and the human dimension of technology.",

  technicalHeading: "Technical contributions & experience highlights",
  technicalHighlights:
    "- Led product discovery and system definition for a novel MRI platform, " +
    "bridging research prototypes and product-ready hardware in a deep-tech environment\n\n" +

    "- Built and scaled cross-functional engineering teams across electronics, mechanics, software, and manufacturing\n\n" +

    "- Designed and validated complex embedded and hardware systems (PCBs up to 12 layers, embedded firmware in C, factory test infrastructure)\n\n" +

    "- Defined EVT-stage requirements for new medical devices, aligning clinical, regulatory, and business constraints\n\n" +

    "- Deployed factory-wide testing and validation systems used across multiple product generations and thousands of units\n\n" +

    "- Background in embedded systems, power electronics, medical imaging, real-time acquisition, and hardware–software integration"

    title: "About Ricardo Ferreira",
    aboutHeading: "About",
    intro: "I’m a product-driven engineer working at the intersection of hardware, software, and complex systems, with more than a decade of experience in medtech, embedded systems, and product leadership. I’m currently based in Paris, France, and I originally trained as a biomedical and electrical engineer in Portugal.",
    fullBio: `
    My early career was deeply technical. I started in embedded systems, power electronics, and real-time software, working on energy-efficiency devices, industrial control, and medical instrumentation. During this time, I was involved in hands-on design across electronics, firmware, mechanics, and testing — experiences that shaped how I think about systems as a whole, not just individual components.

    Over time, my focus naturally shifted from building individual subsystems to owning entire products. At Dreem, I evolved from hardware engineering into a technical product role, contributing to the company’s transition from a device-centric organization to a digital sleep clinic. I worked closely with clinical, regulatory, and executive teams to define new hardware platforms, build industrialization pipelines, and deploy factory-wide testing systems used across thousands of medical devices.

    More recently, at Chipiron, an early-stage deep-tech startup developing next-generation MRI systems, I led engineering and product definition for the company’s first in-vivo MRI platform. I worked directly with C-level leadership and researchers to translate experimental research into clear, manufacturable, and testable product requirements. This included building and leading a multidisciplinary team spanning electronics, RF, mechanics, software, and manufacturing, as well as driving system-level co-design across quantum sensing, cryogenics, and MRI subsystems.

    Throughout my career, I’ve been motivated by the same problem: how to turn advanced technology into reliable, usable products. I care deeply about alignment — between research and engineering, hardware and software, product vision and execution — and I’ve learned that clarity, shared understanding, and good systems thinking matter as much as technical excellence.

    Outside of work, I’m a lifelong learner with a strong interest in human behavior, neurodiversity, and team dynamics. I’m also a sports enthusiast and a cyclist. Most importantly, I am a father, which has profoundly shaped how I think about time, priorities, and the kind of impact I want my work to have — both professionally and personally.
